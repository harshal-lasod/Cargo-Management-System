# Cargo Management System

## Overview

The **Cargo Management System** is a logistics management tool designed to efficiently handle and organize cargo in a galaxy-wide shipping network. This system employs advanced data structures, including AVL trees, to track and manage cargo bins, objects, and their capacities. The system supports efficient insertion, deletion, and searching of cargo based on various attributes like bin capacity, object size, and cargo color.

## Features

- **Efficient Cargo Storage**: AVL trees are used to manage and balance bin and object data, ensuring quick lookups and modifications.
- **Multi-Level Organization**:
  - Bins are categorized by their capacities and IDs.
  - Objects are categorized by size and associated bins.
- **Color-Based Search**: The system allows searching for bins based on their color, making retrieval fast and intuitive.
- **Fast Object Assignment**: New objects are dynamically assigned to the best available bin based on current capacity.
- **Easy Object Management**: Objects can be added or removed from bins with minimal computational overhead, ensuring scalable cargo management.

## Data Structures

The GCMS uses three AVL trees for managing the cargo:

1. **Bin Tree**: Keys are tuples `(capacity, bin_id)` and values are bin instances. This AVL tree helps in organizing and retrieving bins based on their capacity and ID.
   
2. **Object Tree**: Keys are `object_id` and values are tuples `(bin_instance, object_size)`. This AVL tree tracks the objects and their respective bin locations.

3. **Bin-ID Tree**: Keys are `bin_id` and values are bin instances. This tree allows quick access to bins using their unique IDs.

## Class Structure

- **Bin Class**: Contains attributes such as `capacity`, `bin_id`, and an AVL tree of objects that stores the sizes of objects in the bin.
  
- **Object Class**: Holds information about the object such as `object_id`, `size`, and its associated bin.

- **GCMS Core Logic**: The main system logic handles bin and object allocation, searches based on color, and capacity management.

## Installation and Setup

To use the GCMS, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/galactic-cargo-management-system.git
cd galactic-cargo-management-system
